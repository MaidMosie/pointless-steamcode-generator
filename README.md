# pointless-steamcode-generator
A program that generates a 15 character alphanumeric string following the format of steam's gift cards.

## Technically, 
it's illegal for you to use this (or for me to make it). However, the chances of guessing and entering in a valid code are practically quadrillions to one.

## Requirements
`Cargo` needs to be installed in order to build this. see [Rust's installation Page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) in order to install it.

## Building

### Windows
<!-- :) -->
### Linux
Do the following in your shell.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/MaidMosie/pointless-steamcode-generator.git
cd pointless-steamcode-generator
cargo build
```
